## About The Project

To detect cancer in high resolution iamge, my project chooses to distract patch at level 5, 6, and 7 as my input so I can speed up in the process of trainging model. 

The project trains two single-scale models -- InceptionV3 and a simple model trained from scratch by using patches distracted at level 5 image and two multi-scale models based on the models built in single-scale part. It also applies data augmentation to improve the model.

To measure the performance of the best model choosen from the four models, the project uses accuracy, precision, and recall as metrics. In the end, heatmaps of three test slides are generated by the best model.



## Getting Started

Upload all the data listed in Dataset to your Google Drive and then run the .ipynb file on Goole Colab.



Watchout: RAM is strictly constrained in Colab, you may need to save results in the middle of the file for reuse after RAM is fully occupied and kernel restarts.



## Analysis

I generally provide my analysis in my report with all the code showing how to reach myresults. The report is divided into 11 parts -- Project Summary, Modules and Functions, Train Test Split and Validation Setup, Distract Patches at level 5, 6 and 7, Evaluation Method, Single Scale -- Transfer Learning, Single Scale -- Simple Model, Multi Scale -- InceptionV3 with Last 30 Layers Trainable, Multi Scale -- Simple Model, Result and Conclusion, and Further Work.
